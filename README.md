- I have worked on Formula Trinity, an autonomous racing team from Dublin which competes in Formula Student UK. Last year we won the Tata Elxsi FSAI best design prize
- I have some code investigating different areas of physics such as [statistical thermodynamics](https://github.com/KarlNichlsn/STATISTICAL_THERMO) and [supernovae](https://github.com/KarlNichlsn/PHYSICS_PROJs/tree/main/SUPERNOVAE_REDSHIFT_COSMOLOGY) and also some more computational stuff like [principal component analysis]()
- I used SMA data to look at the molecular gas in [NGC891](https://github.com/KarlNichlsn/NGC891) for my thesis
  
- I'm currently self teaching ML from complete basics (no tensorflow!) like [this]()
